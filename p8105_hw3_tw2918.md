# Problem 1

### 1. Load Data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

### 2. write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illustrative examples of observations.

- The dataset contains cleaned and limited data of the “The Instacart
  Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, which records theover 3 million
  online grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. \*The
  dataset contains 1384617 observations and 15 variables. Each
  `row`/observation in the dataset is a product from an order.
- Some variables reflect key identifications of the orders and customers
  including `order_id` and `order_id`. There is a single order per
  consumers in this dataset.
- `eval_set`reflects evaluation set this order belongs in, which is
  exclusively “`train`” in this dataset.
- `order_number` reflects the order sequence number for this user. Its
  value ranges from 4 to100. The average order_number is 17.0914101.
- Some variables reflect key information of the products, including
  `product_id` and `product_name`, which aisle and department the
  prodcuts are purchased from, including `aisle_id`, `aisle`,
  `department_id` and `department`, and the order in which each product
  was added to cart `add_to_cart_order` , from 1 to 80.
- `reordered` variable is a binary indicator off this prodcut has been
  ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise.
- The rest of the varialbes reflect date and time of the order,
  including the day of the week on which the order was placed
  `order_dow` , the hour of the day on which the order was placed,
  `order_hour_of_day`, and days since the last order, capped at `30`,
  `NA` if `order_number=1`. The average days since the last order is
  13.5775922.
